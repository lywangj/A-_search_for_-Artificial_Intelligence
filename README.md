### Optimal_path_with_AI_search

Implement an efficient search system with Artificial Intelligent search algorithms (greedy best-first search and A* search) for path search engine in C++, consuming only 0.01% of searching time and memory usage as compared with another approach with breadth-first search.

```
Searching by bfs ...
Minimum steps: 5, Total steps: 1118480
Time taken by breadth first search: 15530117 microseconds

Searching by A* search ...
Minimum steps: 5, Total steps: 96
Time taken by A* search: 1668 microseconds
```

**Optimal path**:
